	How to use a Matlab code as a standalone application 


1. download and install Matlab Runtime on your machine with corresponding version:
	-download version here : https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
	-how to install non-interactively here : https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/dotnet/install-the-matlab-runtime.html

2. compile your code in Matlab using the command : mcc -m -R -nodisplay YourScript.m,
		-an executable “YourScript” is created


3. define the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH as shown in the readme created during the compilation.


Tips for deployment on DSCI :
	The DSCI on AWS is a linux machine, so the code should be compiled on a linux machine.
	if you don't have one with Matlab installed, try doing the compilation on GreatLakes, that's what I did for TMJSeg.m
